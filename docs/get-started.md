## 2. Hello World!
<br />

Here's a quick explanation on how to start using the compiler.

Once everything is installed, open the main.py file of the project. 
As you can see, the main() function is taking care of compiling, linking and running the file it is given in argument. 
This function is called at the end of the main.py file. By default it will compile the test.py file in the project and place the 
executable named "a" in the "build" folder, but you can change this by changing the arguments that are given to the main() function.

Here you are, you now have a very fast executable that you can run whenever you want!
