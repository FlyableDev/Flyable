## Introduction
Welcome to the official Flyable GitHub repository! 😊🎉🥳

Flyable is a Python just-in-time compiler that generates optimized native code to decrease Python workloads. 
<!--Based on benchmarks from [The Python Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/python/pyperformance), Flyable delivers on average a 2 times speedup without having to modify your code. -->

Flyable works hand in hand with the interpreter in the sense that when Flyable can compile a function 
or method it does so and the interpreter executes that compiled function at runtime and otherwise Flyable lets the interpreter 
interpret this function or method.

## Benchmarks
Detailed benchmarks to come soon! You can see previous benchmarks [here](https://www.flyabledev.com/benchmarks.html).

## Supported platforms
Flyable currently supports the following OS and architectures:

🪟 x86 instructions that run on Windows 64 bits.

🍎 ARM instructions that run on MacOS 64 bits. 

🐧 x86 instructions that run on Linux 64 bits.

32 bits support isn’t planned in the near future.

## Getting Started
All you will need is a working CPython installation (do not run Flyable inside a venv) and some Python code to compile. 
Simply install Flyable on your computer using the pip command: <br/> <kbd>pip install flyable</kbd> <br/>and you will be ready to start using Flyable! 
Once this is done add these two lines in your python code:
<pre><code>import flyable
flyable.run(email="your.email@domain")</code></pre>
Now if you run your code, Flyable will compile it and execute it. Since we are still working on the beta version, we collect emails in order to ask for feedback. We will only use your email for this purpose and will not share it with anybody else.
<!-- add link to use the plugins when it's available -->

## How does it get faster ?
Flyable does multiple things to generate efficient code but most of the performance gains come from the following:
- Native execution of the code
- Static function dispatch (enabling direct call and efficient inlining)
- Type tracking (When possible)
- Function specialization depending on the signature but also on the usage

## Roadmap
Our work is currently focused on integrating new optimizations and getting the compiler to support more syntactic features in order to increase the  proportion of functions and methods that are compiled. 🛣️🚗

<!--You can see a detailed roadmap [here](https://github.com/FlyableDev/Flyable/projects/1).-->
